# Image Gallery Project

This project is an interactive **Image Gallery** created as part of my **front-end development internship with CodeAlpha**. The gallery allows users to navigate through a collection of images using buttons, with smooth transitions and a responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Navigation Buttons**: Users can navigate through the gallery using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions provide a smooth sliding effect between images.
- **Loop Navigation**: The gallery loops back to the first image after the last one and vice versa.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout for the image gallery.
- **CSS**: Styling for layout, transitions, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and logic for navigation and image transitions.
